# Twitter Emoji (Twemoji) In OpenSCAD

A Twemoji is a set of emoji release by twitter in 2014 that provides standard Unicode [emoji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) support across all platforms.
This package supports inserting those characters with color to height mapping in OpenSCAD.


**Twemoji v14.0** adheres to the [Unicode 14.0 spec](https://unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/) and supports the [Emoji 14.0 spec](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-21.html).



## Installing
This is a rather hefty thing to install at least by the standard of libraries.
But is only a few hundred MB so is no problem on a modern computer, with decent internet.
It is so large because it includes thousands of SVGs.

However, we consider the guide a bit onerous and as a project, will accept a mention in a project README or an 'About' section or footer on a website. In mobile applications, a common place would be in the Settings/About section (for example, see the mobile Twitter application Settings->About->Legal section). We would consider a mention in the HTML/JS source sufficient also.
